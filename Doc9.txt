The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved a major milestone in its ambitious human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan, by successfully conducting the first Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT-01) on August 24, 2025.

This test was designed to demonstrate the end-to-end performance of the parachute-based deceleration system that will play a critical role in ensuring the safe return of astronauts from space.

The trial was executed collaboratively with the Indian Air Force, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Navy, and Indian Coast Guard, showcasing the multi-agency synergy required for Indiaâ€™s most complex space mission to date.

Following the success, ISRO announced the achievement on its official handle on X, emphasizing that the integrated air drop exercise is an essential precursor in validating crew module safety and recovery operations.

Building upon earlier progress, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr. Jitendra Singh had recently informed Parliament of significant advancements in the Gaganyaan mission.
