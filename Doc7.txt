Dream-11 has decided to step down as the lead sponsor of the Indian cricket team before the Asia Cup 2025. According to NDTV's report, it will be difficult to see Dream 11 branding on the Indian team's jersey in the Asia Cup starting from September 9.

This decision was taken after the passing of the Online Gaming Bill 2025. The bill has banned real money gaming platforms like Dream 11. Dream 11 had signed a three-year sponsorship contract worth ₹358 crore with BCCI in 2023, which was valid until 2026.

Under this deal, BCCI received ₹3 crore for every home match and ₹1 crore for every match played abroad. After the contract ends, BCCI is now preparing to start the tender process for a new sponsor.

BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that BCCI follows every policy of the central government. If continuing the sponsorship is against regulatory permissions, the board will not take any steps. However, there has been no official confirmation from either BCCI or Dream 11 yet.
