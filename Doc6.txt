Just 16 days before the start of the Asia Cup in the UAE, fantasy sports platform Dream11 reportedly retracted its commitment as the lead jersey sponsor for the Indian cricket team. The development came after 'The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill' was passed by both houses of parliament on Thursday. The bill banned online fantasy sports and gambling platforms. According to a report in NDTV, Dream11 is "not willing to continue its deal" with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). However, both have yet to make an official announcement. The secretary of the national governing body, Devajit Saiki, said the BCCI will adhere to the country's laws. "If it's not permissible, we'll not do anything. The BCCI will follow every policy of the country that is framed by the central government," he said.
