The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully conducted maiden flight tests of the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS), off the Odisha coast around 12.30 pm Sunday.

This marks another step towards developing a homegrown nationwide security shield from multidomain enemy attacks under Mission Sudarshan Chakra by 2035. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said the IADWS is a multi-layered air defence system comprising all indigenous Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missiles (QRSAM), Advanced Very Short Range Air Defence System (VSHORADS) missiles and a high-power laser-based Directed Energy Weapon (DEW).

The development comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the nation on Independence Day, announced the launch of Mission Sudarshan Chakra, a comprehensive, multi-layered, networked system aimed at protecting India and its vital installations from a range of enemy attacks across domains.
