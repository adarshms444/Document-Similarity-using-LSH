India has successfully tested a new integrated air defence system consisting of a variety of weapons that shot down three targets at different altitudes and ranges off the coast of Odisha, the defence ministry said on Sunday. The development comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of a formidable military capability to defend Indiaâ€™s military and civilian installations against aerial attacks and set a 10-year deadline for developing an indigenous air defence shield integrated with offensive weapons under Mission Sudarshan Chakra. The maiden test of the integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS), which is expected to be a part of the bigger national security shield announced by the PM, was conducted by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Saturday.

The IADWS is a multi-layered air defence system consisting of quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAM), very short range air defence system (VSHORADS) and a laser-based directed energy weapon.
